== chef-repo

This is my personal {chef-repo}[http://www.opscode.com/chef] repository, actually I use it to restore my Ubuntu install into my netbook.

== HOWTO

Before executing your recipes you have to run the script initial-config.sh
which installs rubygems (via src) and the chef gem (via rubygem).
